Description: Performs either multiple linear regression or
    logistic regression and provides extensive  model fit and predictive performance metrics,
    data visualizations and regression diagnostics. While many of these functions are available in
    other packages (particularly John Fox's car package), qacReg functions provide a simple, 
    yet comprehensive workflow, and produce results as ggplot2 graphs.
